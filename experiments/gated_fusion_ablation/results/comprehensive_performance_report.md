### Overfitting Analysis

**Models Most Prone to Overfitting:**

- 12_enhanced_triple_loss (BPO): Gap = 0.015
- Model11C_MixtureOfExperts (BPO): Gap = 0.012
- 4_crossmodal_gated (BPO): Gap = 0.012
- 11_enhanced_triple (BPO): Gap = 0.012
- Model11A_TextProtT5Interaction (BPO): Gap = 0.011

**Models with Best Generalization:**

- 7_attention_fusion (BPO): Gap = 0.003
- 0_baseline_esm (BPO): Gap = 0.004
- 0_baseline_text (BPO): Gap = 0.004
- 0_baseline_prott5 (BPO): Gap = 0.005
- 9_ensemble_fusion (BPO): Gap = 0.006

### Recommendations

**Recommended Models by Task:**

- **BPO**: 2_transformed_concat (balanced performance and generalization)

**General Recommendations:**

1. **For production**: Use models with overfitting gap < 0.2
2. **For research**: Enhanced triple modality models show promise
3. **For efficiency**: Adaptive gated models balance performance and complexity
